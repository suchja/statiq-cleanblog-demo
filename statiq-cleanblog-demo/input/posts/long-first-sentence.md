If I understand everything correctly, than the first sentence (or paragraph?) within a post will be used as `excerpt` and thus shown on the main page as kind of teaser! I'm not really sure why this works. It probably means *STATIQ* extracts the `excerpt` in one of its `pipelines`.

## Now we start with the article!
This shouldn't be shown on the main page.

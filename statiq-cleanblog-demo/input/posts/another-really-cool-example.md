This is my new example blog post content.

### Here we have a h3 heading
and some text below the heading!

Now we try something fancy and go for some `public class InlineCodeBlock` and also a more comprehensive C# code block:
```csharp
public class CodeBlock
{
  private string _attribute;

  public CodeBlock {
    _attribute = "Initialized in Constructor!";
  }

  public void SomeMethod(int param1, char param2)
  {
    // Do something here!
  }
}
```
